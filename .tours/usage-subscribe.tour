There is no `QOS=1` functionality with SUBSCRIBE.\n(The `qos=1` parameter that you pass into paho's `subscribe` function is the `qos` that the service uses when sending messages on that subscription.  It has nothing to do with delivery of the `SUBSCRIBE` itself.)"

This is where our sample is missing error handling.  The customer will need to detect the lost SUBACK and send a new SUBSCRIBE.  This is something we can add in future retry helpers or in a Paho convenience layer."
