still needs to be done:
* lotsa comments
* new topic format
* new list of properties and formating thereof
* status code mapping for twin ops
* inputs and outputs (trivial if we have the schema)
* digital twin helpers
* correct api version
* user agent string
* !! code walkthrough.
* sample for identity translation
* translation into node

not gonna do:
* x509 auth helper
* DPS helpers
* async helpers
* Paho helpers
* async workload API interface
* better workload API interface
* reconnect/retry helpers (probably tied to Paho helpers)
* plans for track 2 or iothub broker
