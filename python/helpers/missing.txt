still needs to be done:
* testing of new topic format
* status code mapping for twin ops
* digital twin helpers.  I'm not sure of the scope here. 
* use correct api version
* add user agent strings
* !! code walkthrough.
* samples for identity translation
* translation into node
* distribution plans.  Use pypi/npm, curl-based distribution, or include the helpers with every sample (not recommended)

not gonna do:
* x509 auth helper
* DPS helpers for device/module registration
* async helpers (waitable objects and some auth functionality)
* Paho convenience layers, both callback-based and async.  
* async workload API interface
* more complete workload API interface
* Any significant failure handling, reconnect, and retry code in the samples.  
* reconnect/retry helpers (probably tied to the Paho convenience layer(s))
* plans for track 2 SDK and/or iothub broker
* specific property maps (valid names and correct encoding for track 2 iothub mqtt)
